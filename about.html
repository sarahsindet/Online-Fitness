        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Welcome healthy people or future to-be fit! This is already an effort to change your life. A life which I know you aren't proud of. Don't feel alone cause I was once like you but now am seeing alot of changes in my healthy life. The question is, who deosn't want to be healthy?</p>
        <p>This website is made for the <!--make this words italic--><em>future generation </em><!--it ends here-->and I know you are among them. Let's start by talking about what motivated us to make such a platform in the first place. In our economy, people are involved in different activities that make up their day. We have people who work in offices, shops and many other jobs we have out there. There are but a very few of us who's jobs are physicall, most of us our jobs are mainly using our brains or hands and others it's walking. And at the end of the day, they go home to their families to enjoy the remaining time with them. Everyone uses this time to just relax and watch tv, I mean they are tired right?
           If take a look from the example above of the people we have in the community right now, there is a lot of unfitness going on in someone's life or a life a normal person with normal daily routines.</p>
        <p>There are two things in life, There's the <!--make this bold--><strong>Input</strong><!--input--> and there's the <!--bold the output also--><strong>Output.</strong><!--output-->
           <!--bold--><strong>Input</strong><!--input--> is the practing of taking in. An example is learning and eating. Those two things go into someone's body and mind.
           <!--bold--><strong>Output</strong><!--output--> is the opposite of input and that is giving out or giving back to the community.{Just like we are doing here.} For a learned person, teaching is giving back. For someone who has eaten, it's exercising the body from the energy he got from the food he ate. There should be more output than input but people do the opposite.</p>
        <p>In order to be healthy and avoid the big sickness you know of, one should try atlist to balane the two. We all tend to care more about restaurants, hotels and care less about this kind of fitness progams by following the saying that goes, <!--make it italic--><em>eat well, live well.</em><!--italic--> It's true but people eat too much and they thinlk that is eating well, it's not. Eating well can mean when eating food with calories, you have to release those calories out of your body to avoid getting diabetis or blood pressure. So you see, excising gives you a chance to eat enough chocolate and sugary substance. </p>
        <p>For someone with the normal daily routine we stated above to go and find a gym outside there, that would cut into either his family or work time. So after a while he might decide to just do away with the extra weight here and go back to his old life. This can be because he doesn't have a personal trainer to motivate his or because the gym is far away and reaching it is another work itself. We offer both online and real life fitness programs for the serious ones who are ready to become healthy. We have gyms with trainers all over the country for the people close to the gyms or those with enough time in their hands. </p>
        <p>For the once with tough schedule, there are online training just set for, with real life professional trainers who are here at your service.Once you register with a trainer, he becomes your personal trainer. The work of your personal trainer is to the following;
            <ul>
                <li>Monitor your weight and height</li>
                <li>Check your diet and see if you need one.</li>
                <li>Give you cancelling so that the individuals cannot loose weight.</li>
                <li>set daily/weekly goals to be achieved by individuals.</li>
                <li>Be tough as well as nice to their members.</li>
                <li>Set dates and time for training. This will depend on how they communicate with their members. </li>
            </ul> </p>
        <p>For the individuals who take the onine program, remember even during that lunch break at your working place, you can look for a place where you can train with your trainers live. Remember, there programs are live and you can communicate wih your trainers face to face at the confort of your homes or workplace.
